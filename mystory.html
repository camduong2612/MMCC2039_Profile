		<p id="hero_1stp"> Since high school, I've been captivated by media composition and technology. Ideation and design became integral to me, spending countless hours bringing my imagination to life. I joined extracurriculars as a designer and media campaign manager, freelanced as a PowerPoint designer, and earned a Bachelor of Media and Communication. I'm a creative, enthusiastic learner, passionate about innovative challenges and inspiring environments. Creation defines me.</p>

		<p id="sec2_p2"> In the fabric of our family narrative, my mom's story emerges as a beacon of resilience and ambition. With an innate passion for business, market dynamics, and strategy, she blazed a trail in a landscape where women's presence was scarce. Despite societal barriers, she pursued education at a selective science school, emerging as one of Vietnam's first pioneering businesswomen in engineering and industrial markets. Her journey, marked by audacity and determination, serves as my guiding light, inspiring me to challenge norms and embrace life's adventures with gratitude.</p>
